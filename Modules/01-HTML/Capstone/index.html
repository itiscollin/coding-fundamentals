        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            I was born grew up in a small country of not more than 500 thousand population called Brunei Darussalam; just Brunei ("Bru - nai") for short. I then took my Bachelor Degree in Business Administration in Curtin Malaysia, located in Miri, Sarawak. Just less of an hour long drive, withn no to less traffic of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            Took Business Administration out of "necessity" to complete my study when in fact I wasn't sure what I wanna do next. But during this time, it is when and where I was involved with Entrepreneurship and Startups ecosystem, through Community Building by providing upskilling and reskilling opportunities for the youth and adults.

            <dd>I was first introduce to gaming by my mom (lookin back, I wasnt expecting that either). I remember it fondly, Street of Rage 2 on the Sega Genesis console. Growing up, I've own the PS1 PS2 and now PS4 console. Occasionally will play on PC as well with some friends if not solo campaign games</dd>

        <dt><strong>Technologies</strong></dt>
        <dd>Being a gamer, it's natural to be interested with techs. While I'm not super updated or knowledgable with most techs, I find myself interested with the PC tech world, phones, smart homes ecosystem and many more</dd>

        <dl>
        <dt><strong>Community Building</strong></dt>
        <dd>My interest list wouldn't be completed without ever mentioning this. I enjoyed helping others through educational upskilling and reskilling. Not only it helps others, but it also allows me to meet other interesting people who are with the similar interest.</dd>
